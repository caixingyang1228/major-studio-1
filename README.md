## Rough research between art history and Visual symbols

**Question**: With the collection of the Metropolitan Museum as a sample, which symbols are most commonly found in art？

**Purpose**: What appears in art collections can be seen as something that people cherish during recording and creating civilization. We hope that through this superficial observation, we can see what has become a common symbol in the process of civilized production.

**How to achieve**: Before we take the tag as a markup tool, I first looked at the api's field for more efficient classification. There are many categories that can help me search for specific scope, such as locale, classification, nationality. But this study focuses on the premise of a de-cultural classification, so we are currently giving up using these classifications.

1. By observing the tag type, I found that the classification of tags is quite broad. A large number of types of things that have been marked, such as Men, Women, Portraits, Flowers, Landscapes, and Animals, belong to a category, and are difficult to be considered as effective visual symbol types.
**So, I chose to search for the two most frequent of the two tags that appear at the same time.**

2. Although we can get the frequency of each tag, to compare the number of all tags, you need to use api to view the complete tag database. **I retired and used the number of tags that Met offered us, ranking the top 20. View the frequency rankings of the tags that appear with them, and then rank them by number.**

**Limitations**: Due to the objective reasons of the Metropolitan Museum of Art database, my research results are not destined to project to the entire civilization. Even though the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art cover almost all kinds of works of different periods in the world's major civilizations, the difference in the number of collections in each civilization period will seriously affect the objectivity of using tags as a statistical method. Therefore, this study can only be regarded as an attempt based on the research scope of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Database.
